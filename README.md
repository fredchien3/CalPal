## Background

CalPal is a data visualization webapp that allows users to view the nutritional value of their custom meals.
It receives the user's selection of bowl choices and displays the total calorie, macronutrient, and micronutrient breakdowns.
The goal is to empower users to make more informed nutritional decisions to best support their goals.

## Functionality & MVPs

In CalPal, users will be able to:
- Choose from multiple build-your-bowl chains
- Select from a list of options at each step of the ordering process
- View the visualation of calories, macronutrients, and micronutrients 
In addition, this project will include:
- Saving functionality, allowing users to save their built bowls
- A comparison feature that allows users to view different saved bowls side-by-side, even across different chains
- A production README

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs
